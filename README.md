<h1>Memory Card Game</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

The Memory Card Game is a web-based game where users have to match pairs of symbols until all pairs are successfully matched. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the ReactJS framework.

The objective of the game is to test and improve the player's memory skills. Players need to flip over two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs by remembering the position of each symbol.
